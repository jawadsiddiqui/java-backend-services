## Builder Design Pattern 

- Handle complex constructors
- No Interface required
- Can be a separate class
- Works with the legacy code

### Pitfall


- Immutable
- Inner Static Class
- Designed first
- Complexity



## Prototype

- Implemented around a clone
- Avoids calling complex constructors
- Difficult to implement in legacy code
-
